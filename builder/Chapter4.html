    <p>The previous chapters contained mandatory knowledge to use the <strong>Particle System plugin</strong> as a level builder. This final chapter contains a gathering of miscellaneous tidbits that could still be useful to builders. The features described here help locate issues with coder’s modules, errors with builder’s setups or potential bugs with the plugin itself (to be reported back to the devs), but are ultimately optional and not strictly needed to use the plugin as a builder. For the most part, this chapter broadens the knowledge of builders with some elements of the plugin, used frequently by module coders. This way, it may perhaps inspire builders to consider checking out the coder path too, if it sparks their interest!</p>
